 * @property {number} offset
 *   Optional. An integer that specifies the current offset (that is, starting
 *   result location, amongst the jobs deemed by the API as relevant) in search
 *   results. This field is only considered if
 *   page_token is
 *   unset.
 *
 *   For example, 0 means to  return results starting from the first matching
 *   job, and 10 means to return from the 11th job. This can be used for
 *   pagination, (for example, pageSize = 10 and offset = 10 means to return
 *   from the second page).
 *
 * @property {number} pageSize
 *   Optional. A limit on the number of jobs returned in the search results.
 *   Increasing this value above the default value of 10 can increase search
 *   response time. The value can be between 1 and 100.
 *
 * @property {string} pageToken
 *   Optional. The token specifying the current offset within
 *   search results. See
 *   SearchJobsResponse.next_page_token
 *   for an explanation of how to obtain the next set of query results.
 *
 * @property {string} orderBy
 *   Optional. The criteria determining how search results are sorted. Default
 *   is
 *   `"relevance desc"`.
 *
 *   Supported options are:
 *
 *   * `"relevance desc"`: By relevance descending, as determined by the API
 *     algorithms. Relevance thresholding of query results is only available
 *     with this ordering.
 *   * `"posting_publish_time desc"`: By
 *   Job.posting_publish_time
 *     descending.
 *   * `"posting_update_time desc"`: By
 *   Job.posting_update_time
 *     descending.
 *   * `"title"`: By Job.title
 *   ascending.
 *   * `"title desc"`: By Job.title
 *   descending.
 *   * `"annualized_base_compensation"`: By job's
 *     CompensationInfo.annualized_base_compensation_range
 *     ascending. Jobs whose annualized base compensation is unspecified are put
 *     at the end of search results.
 *   * `"annualized_base_compensation desc"`: By job's
 *     CompensationInfo.annualized_base_compensation_range
 *     descending. Jobs whose annualized base compensation is unspecified are
 *     put at the end of search results.
 *   * `"annualized_total_compensation"`: By job's
 *     CompensationInfo.annualized_total_compensation_range
 *     ascending. Jobs whose annualized base compensation is unspecified are put
 *     at the end of search results.
 *   * `"annualized_total_compensation desc"`: By job's
 *     CompensationInfo.annualized_total_compensation_range
 *     descending. Jobs whose annualized base compensation is unspecified are
 *     put at the end of search results.
 *   * `"custom_ranking desc"`: By the relevance score adjusted to the
 *     SearchJobsRequest.CustomRankingInfo.ranking_expression
 *     with weight factor assigned by
 *     SearchJobsRequest.CustomRankingInfo.importance_level
 *     in descending order.
 *   * Location sorting: Use the special syntax to order jobs by distance:<br>
 *     `"distance_from('Hawaii')"`: Order by distance from Hawaii.<br>
 *     `"distance_from(19.89, 155.5)"`: Order by distance from a coordinate.<br>
 *     `"distance_from('Hawaii'), distance_from('Puerto Rico')"`: Order by
 *     multiple locations. See details below.<br>
 *     `"distance_from('Hawaii'), distance_from(19.89, 155.5)"`: Order by
 *     multiple locations. See details below.<br>
 *     The string can have a maximum of 256 characters. When multiple distance
 *     centers are provided, a job that is close to any of the distance centers
 *     would have a high rank. When a job has multiple locations, the job
 *     location closest to one of the distance centers will be used. Jobs that
 *     don't have locations will be ranked at the bottom. Distance is calculated
 *     with a precision of 11.3 meters (37.4 feet). Diversification strategy is
 *     still applied unless explicitly disabled in
 *     diversification_level.
 *
 * @property {number} diversificationLevel
 *   Optional. Controls whether highly similar jobs are returned next to each
 *   other in the search results. Jobs are identified as highly similar based on
 *   their titles, job categories, and locations. Highly similar results are
 *   clustered so that only one representative job of the cluster is
 *   displayed to the job seeker higher up in the results, with the other jobs
 *   being displayed lower down in the results.
 *
 *   Defaults to
 *   DiversificationLevel.SIMPLE
 *   if no value is specified.
 *
 *   The number should be among the values of [DiversificationLevel]{@link google.cloud.talent.v4beta1.DiversificationLevel}
 *
 * @property {Object} customRankingInfo
 *   Optional. Controls over how job documents get ranked on top of existing
 *   relevance score (determined by API algorithm).
 *
 *   This object should have the same structure as [CustomRankingInfo]{@link google.cloud.talent.v4beta1.CustomRankingInfo}
 *
 * @property {boolean} disableKeywordMatch
 *   Optional. Controls whether to disable exact keyword match on
 *   Job.title,
 *   Job.description,
 *   Job.company_display_name,
 *   Job.addresses,
 *   Job.qualifications. When
 *   disable keyword match is turned off, a keyword match returns jobs that do
 *   not match given category filters when there are matching keywords. For
 *   example, for the query "program manager," a result is returned even if the
 *   job posting has the title "software developer," which doesn't fall into
 *   "program manager" ontology, but does have "program manager" appearing in
 *   its description.
 *
 *   For queries like "cloud" that don't contain title or
 *   location specific ontology, jobs with "cloud" keyword matches are returned
 *   regardless of this flag's value.
 *
 *   Use
 *   Company.keyword_searchable_job_custom_attributes
 *   if company-specific globally matched custom field/attribute string values
 *   are needed. Enabling keyword match improves recall of subsequent search
 *   requests.
 *
 *   Defaults to false.
