/**
 * A resource that represents the profile for a job candidate (also referred to
 * as a "single-source profile").
 *
 * @property {string} name
 *   Required during profile update.
 *
 *   Resource name assigned to a profile by the API.
 *
 *   The format is
 *   "projects/{project_id}/tenants/{tenant_id}/profiles/{profile_id}",
 *   for example, "projects/foo/tenants/bar/profiles/baz".
 *
 * @property {string} externalId
 *   Profile's id in client system, if available. This value is unique for each
 *   profile inside a tenant. An error is thrown if another profile with the
 *   same external_id is created.
 *
 *   The maximum number of bytes allowed is 100.
 *
 * @property {string} source
 *   The source description indicating where the profile is acquired.
 *
 *   For example, if a candidate profile is acquired from a resume, the user can
 *   input "resume" here to indicate the source.
 *
 *   The maximum number of bytes allowed is 100.
 *
 * @property {string} uri
 *   The URI set by clients that links to this profile's client-side copy.
 *
 *   The maximum number of bytes allowed is 4000.
 *
 * @property {string} groupId
 *   The cluster id of the profile to associate with other profile(s) for the
 *   same candidate.
 *
 *   This field should be generated by the customer. If a value is not provided,
 *   a random UUID is assigned to this field of the profile.
 *
 *   This is used to link multiple profiles to the same candidate. For example,
 *   a client has a candidate with two profiles, where one was created recently
 *   and the other one was created 5 years ago. These two profiles may be very
 *   different. The clients can create the first profile and get a generated
 *   group_id, and assign it
 *   when the second profile is created, indicating these two profiles are
 *   referring to the same candidate.
 *
 * @property {Object} isHirable
 *   Indicates the hirable status of the candidate.
 *
 *   This object should have the same structure as [BoolValue]{@link google.protobuf.BoolValue}
 *
 * @property {Object} createTime
 *   The timestamp when the profile was first created at this source.
 *
 *   This object should have the same structure as [Timestamp]{@link google.protobuf.Timestamp}
 *
 * @property {Object} updateTime
 *   The timestamp when the profile was last updated at this source.
 *
 *   This object should have the same structure as [Timestamp]{@link google.protobuf.Timestamp}
 *
 * @property {Object} candidateUpdateTime
 *   The timestamp when the profile was last updated as a result of a direct or
 *   indirect action by a candidate.
 *
 *   These actions include:
 *
 *   * Direct actions such as the candidate submitting a new resume as part of a
 *   job application to the agency, using a self-service tool such as a website
 *   to update their profile, and so on.
 *   * Indirect actions by the candidate such as uploading a resume to a job
 *   board that is collected by the agency through a feed, providing a resume to
 *   a recruiter who then uploads it into the ATS, and so on.
 *   * Updates made to the candidate's profile by the recruiter as a result of
 *   interacting with the candidate (for example adding a skill or work
 *   preference, and so on). Changes to
 *   recruiting_notes
 *   are specifically excluded from this action type.
 *
 *   Note:
 *   candidate_update_time
 *   must be greater than or equal to
 *   resume_update_time
 *   or an error is thrown.
 *
 *   This object should have the same structure as [Timestamp]{@link google.protobuf.Timestamp}
 *
 * @property {Object} resumeUpdateTime
 *   The timestamp when the candidate's resume was added or updated on the
 *   candidate's profile. Whether that resume was directly uploaded by a
 *   candidate, pulled from a 3rd party job board feed, added by a recruiter,
 *   and so on.
 *
 *   If this field is updated, it's expected that
 *   resume is provided in the
 *   create or update calls.
 *
 *   This object should have the same structure as [Timestamp]{@link google.protobuf.Timestamp}
 *
 * @property {Object} resume
 *   The resume representing this profile.
 *
 *   This object should have the same structure as [Resume]{@link google.cloud.talent.v4beta1.Resume}
 *
 * @property {Object[]} personNames
 *   The names of the candidate this profile references.
 *
 *   Currently only one person name is supported.
 *
 *   This object should have the same structure as [PersonName]{@link google.cloud.talent.v4beta1.PersonName}
 *
 * @property {Object[]} addresses
 *   The candidate's postal addresses. It's highly recommended to
 *   input this information as accurately as possible to help improve search
 *   quality. Here are some recommendations:
 *
 *   * Provide Address.usage if
 *   possible, especially if the address is PERSONAL. During a search only
 *   personal addresses are considered. If there is no such address, all
 *   addresses with unspecified usage are assumed to be personal.
 *   * Provide Address.current
 *   for the current address if possible. During a search, only current
 *   addresses are considered. If there is no such address, all addresses are
 *   assumed to be current.
 *
 *   When displaying a candidate's addresses, it is sometimes desirable to limit
 *   the number of addresses shown. In these cases we recommend that you display
 *   the addresses in the following order of priority:
 *   1. Address.usage is PERSONAL
 *   and Address.current is true.
 *   2. Address.usage is PERSONAL
 *   and Address.current is false
 *   or not set.
 *   3. Address.usage is
 *   CONTACT_INFO_USAGE_UNSPECIFIED and
 *   Address.current is true.
 *   4. Address.usage is
 *   CONTACT_INFO_USAGE_UNSPECIFIED and
 *   Address.current is false or
 *   not set.
 *
 *   This object should have the same structure as [Address]{@link google.cloud.talent.v4beta1.Address}
 *
 * @property {Object[]} emailAddresses
 *   The candidate's email addresses.
 *
 *   This object should have the same structure as [Email]{@link google.cloud.talent.v4beta1.Email}
 *
 * @property {Object[]} phoneNumbers

 *
 * @property {Object[]} additionalContactInfo
 *   Available contact information besides
 *   addresses,
 *   email_addresses,
 *   phone_numbers and
 *   personal_uris. For
 *   example, Hang-out, Skype.
 *
 *   This object should have the same structure as [AdditionalContactInfo]{@link google.cloud.talent.v4beta1.AdditionalContactInfo}
 *
 * @property {Object[]} employmentRecords
 *   The employment history records of the candidate. It's highly recommended
 *   to input this information as accurately as possible to help improve search
 *   quality. Here are some recommendations:
 *
 *   * Specify the start and end dates of the employment records.
 *   * List different employment types separately, no matter how minor the
 *   change is.
 *   For example, only job title is changed from "software engineer" to "senior
 *   software engineer".
 *   * Provide
 *   EmploymentRecord.is_current
 *   for the current employment if possible. If not, it's inferred from user
 *   inputs.
 *
 *   The limitation for max number of employment records is 100.
 *
 *   This object should have the same structure as [EmploymentRecord]{@link google.cloud.talent.v4beta1.EmploymentRecord}
 *
 * @property {Object[]} educationRecords
 *   The education history record of the candidate. It's highly recommended to
 *   input this information as accurately as possible to help improve search
 *   quality. Here are some recommendations:
 *
 *   * Specify the start and end dates of the education records.
 *   * List each education type separately, no matter how minor the change is.
 *   For example, the profile contains the education experience from the same
 *   school but different degrees.
 *   * Provide
 *   EducationRecord.is_current
 *   for the current education if possible. If not, it's inferred from user
 *   inputs.
 *
 *   The limitation for max number of education records is 100.
 *
 *   This object should have the same structure as [EducationRecord]{@link google.cloud.talent.v4beta1.EducationRecord}
